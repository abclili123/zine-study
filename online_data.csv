I don't feel as if I know what I might use them for, or what tools are really available to me. To be honest, I'm not really sure what you mean by ""electronics"" --- it feels fairly vague. I think I'd be more excited about learning these skills if I had a particular project in mind, even if I didn't yet know how to carry it out. Even so, I'm excited to hear more about them, and get a better sense of them in this meeting! Maybe it'll be the push I need to get started. ","The Arduino and Joystick materials made the possibilities of learning electronics feel much wider, which I appreciated---it was nice to see someone else's project, and to hear all the ways that you could interface electronics with code. Separately, though, the first reading looked a lot like a wikipedia page, which made it inherently feel sort of dry, and made me feel inclined to skim (I resisted the urge). I wanted more visuals to aid in my learning. I found myself hoping for a video or a chance to do something with my hands (or even just some step by step pictures), in order to really grasp what it was the readings were discussing. There were moments when I gave up and said, ""when I do the hands on portion, I'll get it"". All in all, I found the material interesting, but wanted either a hands on portion or another, more visual learning style in order to feel like I really understood it. "

I like working with software and digital applications, but when it comes to actual technology (like laser cutting or welding) I do get pretty intimidated since it's not as easy as clicking random buttons and seeing what they do—at least, from my perspective as someone with no prior experiences. Another large barrier when it comes to learning electronics is access. I'm very lucky to have the Design Center at my disposal, and I don't use it as often as I should. Electronics cost money, and there's many different groups of people who lack the access to these resources.","The learning material is similar to the process I would embark on if I tried to experiment with electronics myself: I don't like using videos and prefer reading through website/written tutorials. I liked how in-depth the materials were---it was a lot of content, but I liked that since it feels like I can learn as much as possible. I disliked how the information was not accompanied by any interactive component (which I know is a part of the study). It was difficult to be met with all these words, not enough pictures or videos, and nothing to experiment on. I am familiar with breadboards and have experience coding in several languages, so I would feel relatively comfortable carrying out the tasks in the website so long as I was able to refer to it while experimenting. I will say though that the Arduino website was really confusing to me... After all that content, I'm not sure whether I understand what an Arduino is.

On the questions regarding the busyness of the Design Center: there's two tables filled up, including the ones used for the research study, as well as some people who came in, so it was relatively noisy. Noise levels weren't too bad, but significantly affected how I took in the information since I need silence when trying to read about new, unfamiliar topics. I marked not being interested in experimenting in the Design Center since I'm not really much of an electrical engineering person & am not personally interested. Cool project though!!! Lowkey would try to control a LED with a joystick, it feels like something I could do if I had the materials."

Really the only point of perspective I have for this is what I had to build my own desktop computer a few years ago and had a hard time keeping those things straight. I think also just like general unfamiliarity with the importance of certain parts (and which ones can be easily damaged too),I think th format itself of the information was straightforward enough. Probably my least favorite of them was the designbuildlab website because it looked so much like wikipedia. I would prefer for the information to be a little more spread out i think and with a somewhat better UI. My favorite of them was the arduino one becaus of the better interface. I will admit I wasn't super engaged but I think that is probably an effect of the content more than the layout.

Based on the above, I would consider myself a visual and solitary learner, which can make learning new skills difficult if I am not given a visual diagram/drawing of how to do it or a video. Trying to read a textbook or listen to a podcast which may explain electronics would be difficult for me, and I believe serves as a barrier to learning. An additional barrier that I would foresee in learning electronics is my lack of previous hands-on experience and few opportunities for application of the skills I would learn. I suppose the investment of money, time, and energy would also limit my ability to learn, as currently I do not know if I have time to learn electrons and wouldn’t know where to start. There also may be a gendered aspect to this, as young women are often not taught practical skills such as electronics early on. It is also worth noting that much of this is conjecture as I have never attempted to learn electronics.","Reading the online material was more engaging than reading a textbook–especially given the more conversational/even entertaining way it was written–but I also felt myself at times zoning out and having to reread a section multiple times. It may be worth noting that I have some minor dyslexia and have always considered myself a visual learner, so reading larger blocks of text can be difficult for me. I do feel like I have a better understanding of circuits, but would still be intimidating to make my own; I also did not really understand the schematic diagram despite finishing the reading. I probably would need someone to explain the connections or have clearer labels regarding what each connection was. I did appreciate how the information was presented in sections and the tone that the text was written in, but I did at times feel a bit overwhelmed or even bored as I was reading it. Arudino also seems a bit confusing, and (probably since I am not a CS major) I didn't really understand the coding portion. "

Before college, those materials were not readily available, and (given that I had no experience or knowledge about electronics) I had no reason to actively seek them out just for experimentation’s sake. I know the design center has materials to use, but I hesitate to experiment because I don’t know where to begin/the possibilities. I usually try out new materials when there’s a workshop so that it’s a fun learning environment with an expert where the assumption is that people are mostly beginners. I’d love to learn more about electronics - I’ve only ever used them to make a mini car in a middle school science class which was fun. I also would love to learn how to mess with the electronics behind lighting fixtures/lamps. I had a class where we made lamps, but I didn’t particularly experiment with the actual electronics part (more so just the wooden form/lamp “shade”).","Reading this material is helpful because you can go at your own pace and go back to reference past information. The diagrams/schematics are extremely helpful. It would be much more helpful to have more images with labels and diagrams. I also think a video would be very helpful. And, of course, for electronics it seems it would be most helpful to actually try it out in real life (making a closed loop, lighting up an LED, experimenting with Arduino). It was hardest to understand the Arduino part / what it can be used to make specifically. I think it's hard to envision what those projects mean when you haven't seen them before. The metaphor with the radiator system was helpful, but it made me want to know more about how voltage/current/resistance comes up when you're experimenting with a circuit."

I was learning about wires and circuits on my own since my HS did not teach it in our science classes. We also did not have any CS or electronic courses. Most of my learning was done on my own or with 1-2 other people in the group. I initially felt overwhelmed since I was jumping into the deep end without any foundation but I quickly found enjoyment in learning about logic and wiring processes. 

I later on began to teach lego mindstorm to young students which was coding and electronics. This gave me a lot of confidence since I knew how to code by this point and was learning with my students about the electronics part. Hope this helps LOL","I disliked how wordy the first article was or at least how it was formatted. It was nice to see and have some concepts from high school listed out like Ohm's Law. Since I was familiar with Arduino before, I was able to skim the second article. The third article was interesting to read but would be more beneficial if I was following along to make the actual project. Ultimately, I perceived the learning material to be effective and useful since the concepts added up to the project. The project was a good one because of it's simple and easy instructions and cool applications!"

This is usually okay with other crafts, but electronics are a little more sensitive and button mashing might result in broken machinery, so there's a learning curve there where I have to be more patient and read through instructions more thoroughly BEFORE beginning any work. But, this makes figuring out the tool so much more rewarding. I'm also pretty comfortable with most electronics, so learning new softwares can be frustrating when it's not easy. With many crafts, you can kinda just fanagle it together until it works too but that's not the case for some electronics lik the cricuit. Figuring it out is always fun though because once you've done the hard part, it makes creating so much more efficient.","I thought the blocks of text made the learning very boring a difficult. I was excited by the topic and tried my best to engage but there was nothing to supplement the new concept so it was hard to follow along. If there were more images or videos, it would be easier to understand what's going on and be engaged with it. Usually, I learn through videos or instructables that have simple, step by step instructions and images. These blocks of text were dense and difficult to me which made me bored and upset with being unable to understand the topic. I don't think a quieter environment would have helped at all. Following along the instructions with a physical project of my own would also make it easier and more fun to understand the material."

I also feel like anything that sounds more technical I’m hesitant to learn because I associate learning with a high cost, and I would be worried about breaking something that is expensive. I have no idea how expensive the tools are or even if you need anything fancy, but the fear of breaking something expensive has been enough of a barrier to keep me from learning. In general though I would say the biggest barrier is that I don’t know what it is or why I should experiment with it or learn about it, so I haven’t done as much to explore electronics. I am very open to learning though, I just haven’t found the best environment though to do that yet.","I did like the structure of the content, with headings and subheadings that were easy to follow along. However, I found the pure reading component to not be as helpful. There were some images along the way, but they felt disconnected from the main information / text, so it was hard for me to easily connect the words to the schematics / etc. I also found that it was super difficult to stay engaged in the reading with the business of the Design Center. The readings were not engaging enough, and I found that I would very easily be distracted by other things going on, or I would realize that I ""read"" an entire paragraph without actually comprehending or internalizing any of it.

In particular, I liked the hacker.io materials because the content was effectively divided, short, simple, and included stimulating images. I also liked the use of bullet points to convey information in the Arduino and Wikipedia pages. The Wikipedia page initially felt a little boring though. The information was definitely less dense than typical Wikipedia pages, but seeing all the text on the page made me dread going through everything. Additionally, a loud conversation began to take place in the Design Center which made it challenging to focus.

","I found the first article to be most useful through its analogy of the radiator system. Also, I found the step-by-step instructions in ""Activity 1: Completing the circuit"" extremely helpful for visualizing the project, as well as the list of causes for error. The two articles about the Joystick Interactive circuit project were helpful to me as a way to see what the path of learning electronics may look like, but I think I would have understood these articles much better if there was a video of the project or more photos as I learn better from visual aid.

Considering they were explaining a physical project/item, I think more visual elements would be helpful.

I have seen a breadbox, LED, and other circuitboards (not Arduino) before, which helped me visualize and understand somewhat, but without background knowledge I think I would have been lost.

Although I do not have a solid foundation in computer science, I do have an intermediate level of digital literacy that would allow me to feel comfort exploring unfamiliar electronics.

The Arduino and Joystick pages were the most enjoyable to access—particularly due to the formatting, length, and clarity. Although I recognize that the language was concise and straightforward, I think the vocabulary in the first article made it hard to truly dig into the concepts.

It often also feels like you need to know exactly which motor you need for a project when usually, whatever you have lying around works well :).","The format was very Wikipedia style, which wasn't super fun or easy to read. I don't think it would've been easy to try to follow along with this material while trying to build a circuit, and only the schematics would've been helpful. I think there was a big jump between ""what is Ohm's law"" and ""What is an Arduino"". I don't think Ohm's law is as important in circuits as knowing what Vcc, Vin, Vout, etc are."

But perhaps my reason for not desiring to learn more about electronics comes from feeling like it is not particularly accessible or a welcoming community. Back in high school the robotics team was notoriously misogynistic, and I think that association probably stuck with me. That being said, I never had a point where I actively wanted to learn about electronics but then stopped because of anything/because of an unwelcome environment. Thinking about this makes me feel excited about pushing myself to learn more!","I liked how everything was presented very straightforwardly. I thought the headings were easy to follow and informative and properly clued me in to what I was about to learn. That being said, I think there was still some jargon employed (even in the bits explicitly meant for beginners) that encountering made me feel less confident and more unsure of myself. I would have appreciated a lot more schematics and drawings. Especially when considering circuits or anything that is being physically made, I think it would have been really helpful to have more images or illustrations that give you a concrete example of what is being discussed. While I didn't necessarily feel lost while doing the readings, I think schematics definitely would have made me feel more sure of myself."

I feel as if there is some large prerequisite in order to begin building things. Although I’ve done some basic circuit building, it would be difficult to imagine doing it all on my own without a reference / create a new circuit. It really helps to have a clear idea of what it is you want to do though. ","I enjoyed the organization of the DaBL page and thought that the writing was very clear. However, I think part of the straightforwardness of the page probably had to do with my previous experience with electronics. I disliked, however, that there weren't that many images on the page / even the typography did not highlight ""important"" versus ""unimportant"" information. I thought that the Joystick interactive circuit project part 2 page was more engaging, especially because it had an image of the circuit and parts. I thought I would've benefitted from more labeling though, and the code could have been commented more to explain what was going on. I actually really liked the format of the hackster.io circuit project websites––especially the way the sections were split up into parts including story, schematics, and code. I thought it helped in giving me a general overview before delving into specifics. "

For example, even after attending an embroidery workshop at the design center, I was not able to easily navigate the software on my own. This may be because of the complex interface. I followed each step on the zine but still needed help from the design center team when editing and exporting the file. Overall, the task may come with challenges but I always feel proud with my final products.","Reading through the material, I liked how I got a detailed account of the topic because of the neat format and analogies used in the writing. Workshop: Introduction to Electronics and What is Aurdino were helpful readings because they explained the concepts in easy terms. But the hackster articles that described the actual project was not as easy of a read because I was not able to follow along as I read, I couldn't fully visualize. I was overall confused when reading the hackster ""story"" section but got a better understanding after looking at the ""schematics."" Finally, the code was straightforward but would be better if it was heavily commented if a non programmer was looking at it. "
