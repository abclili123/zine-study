I feel like there are projects I would like to complete with electronics, however I am not very interested in the basics of electronics. I guess that is why I have not learned much about electronics to begin with. Also I feel like electronics have the expectation that they require math which I am not very good that. ","I liked the comparisons in the beginning to how electricity is like water, the pictures were also very helpful. I feel confident in my understanding of the intro to Breadboard, again the illustrations and colors made learning this very engaging. However, I was quite lost when I go to the Arduino parts. Especially the the Joystick Schematic part. I am still a bit unsure where all the wires connect (in the turn the page for answers part). But besides that I feel like I understood the very basics of electricity a bit better!"

Electronics is something I've always wanted to get into, but whenever I search things up online, there's so much content, but I don't know which one to look at and there's so many beginner tools, but I'm not sure which one to buy and they can get quite expensive. I'm also not really good at independent learning, but if I had someone to sit me down and teach me everything, then it would be a lot more helpful. It makes me feel like I'm limiting myself and preventing myself from learning a skill I've always wanted to experiment and learn more about.","I like how the zine got straight to the point and was very concise in providing information and context. I like the images that the zine included, and everything was very clear and step by step. I also liked the tone of the zine since it was very friendly and encouraging. There's nothing I dislike about the zine, but if I had to say a critique, I would say that something that limits a zine is that even if there are clear steps, there's always gaps in between that can't be filled in due to the way zines are limited to still images in comparison to something like an instructional video. The images and clear and concise steps helped me understand a lot, and it made me feel supported, and it was very encouraging."

I like to know how things work before learning how to use them, so it can also be difficult to know where I should start understanding new tools. Before college, I had very little exposure to electronics. This, for a while, prevented me from having a framework through which I could learn new technologies. Being at Barnard and having access to lots of resources  -- mainly mentors and peers who talk with you and additionally refer you to helpful books and websites -- made me more confident in approaching electronics. I'm also a CS major now, which helps.","I thought that the material was engaging and helpful as an introduction into circuit design. I liked especially the analogy to water because it helped me more clearly understand how electricity flows. I thought the breakdown of the components and assembly was also easy to follow such that I felt guided through this process. The quiz in the middle also checked for comprehension in a useful way. At the same time, I enjoyed elements of the zine that fostered exploration such as the links to resources about learning Arduino. "

While I personally like to dive head first into projects, I find this to be difficult when trying to learn about electronics as it feels like there are certain prerequisites required before starting. Learning about electronics is quite intimidating and it feels risky if I make a mistake. There also seems to be a large knowledge divide between those who know certain information versus those who are coming in without any knowledge beforehand, which can make it harder to feel confident in one's learning.","I have used zines provided by the design center to complete previous projects so I have prior  experience in using zines. I enjoyed the encouraging nature of this zine as well as the examples that it provided really helped me to understand complex problems. However, as someone who feels more comfortable being taught with hands on experience, the zine has its limitations with the total information I could know. With this being said, I do think I would be confident in completing the examples provided in the zine as they felt throughly explored. However, I would likely ask for assistance from a staff member if I was to get stuck. I don't know if I could use the zine for harder problems or more complex projects. It did a good job at introducing me to the topic and gave me a nice place to start."
30,0,4,3,4,3,4,2,4,5,1,1,0,1,1,1,15,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,3,"I haven't seriously considered using the electronics in the design center for a project before, despite knowing that they were available. My initial feelings and thoughts that come to mind when I consider the electronic resources available here, are that they are too complicated for me to use and that I couldn't possibly be creative enough or directed enough to justify my usage of them. 

Because I don't have any project in mind that includes electronics, I feel like it's hard to approach the tools and test them out. Personally, I am more interested in learning other skills in the design center, but think that becoming familiar with the creative uses of electronics are beneficial in the long run, particularly as there are so many unexplored areas in creative/art technology. I think that having some simple beginner projects to learn the basics or fundamentals of electronics would be a great way to allow students to be more comfortable with experimenting and executing more advanced ideas.","I appreciate the bite-sized information that a zine can provide. Having something printed and physical is a very welcome change from digital formatting that I am used to and I feel like this booklet would be most useful to reference when I am actually attempting to learn electronics/testing it out. I do feel like there were moments where the next step or information was not as clear to me and I think the space restrictions of the zine are something to consider for that. While it is a simple walkthrough, I think I could have benefitted from knowing more of the concepts taught in the zine. I found the breadboard particularly difficult to understand, so I think more information or diagrams for that section or clarifications (such as a quiz/question refresher?) would have made it less confusing. I think I would have liked to see different examples of what can be done with electronics and some more step by step breakdown for some circuits that are possible. I think terminology is an important thing to provide in these zines, as then it can lead to further individual exploration by design center users. The trickiest thing is knowing where to look and what to search for. "
31,0,5,5,2,5,2,4,5,5,1,0,0,1,0,1,10,3,3,4,4,5,4,3,5,5,5,3,2,"I think a large barrier to learning more about electronics is the actual process of using different machinery--I find it most useful to have new things demonstrated to me and the sheer potential of a lot of electronics can be overwhelming. Another obstacle is the wide array of options; sometimes it feels as though some mediums provide me with so many different tools that it can be difficult to parse which ones would be useful or practical for me. Also I noted that I am a solitary learner--i think it really depends on the subject and the context. With regards to zine making and more creative endeavors, I find myself preferring learning how to do things alone and then bringing it to a larger group. It can be really difficult for me to grasp instructions/demonstrations in a group setting and teaching myself is often a lot more straightforward.","I really enjoyed the first part of the zine that details how electricity works--I think when working with electronics and other things like this I easily lose the foundational/conceptual knowledge that is extremely important. The diagram comparing water to electricity was also very helpful, though I think I would need to sit with it for a couple more minutes if I was trying to think of how to apply this to my project. The breadboard anatomy diagram was also very helpful in visualizing how to connect the resistors and wires; the page before that describes the anatomy is helpful but verbal descriptions don't really click for me, so having the arrows pointing towards the electricity flow/demonstrating what flow would or wouldn't be supported was incredibly useful. The section about the Arduino was a bit confusing, mainly due to the joystick schematic. I understand that the labels are corresponding to those on the Arduino and are supposed to guide how to connect the wires, but I would have appreciated an explanation of the ports (? I'm not sure if this is what they are called) on the Arduino; for me, knowing what each wire/connection is doing would be very helpful in determining how to use them for a personal project. Overall, I really liked the zine and it was conducive to learning the basics of circuits, with the diagrams being the most helpful when accompanied by an explanation, and I foresee the zine format as being incredibly helpful while working on a project where I don't want to be constantly referring back to my laptop."
32,0,5,4,3,2,4,3,3,5,1,1,0,0,1,1,11,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,3,3,"When I experience an obstacle in learning about electronics, it’s hard to get over those barriers especially if I feel like I’ve exhausted all my own options and there’s no source for help. Not sure if this is related, but whenever I run into an issue with my laptop, for instance, I’ll try to figure out what’s going on on my own by reading info on quora or reddit or some support site before asking someone more savvy like my dad or the Apple Genius Bar. In this sense, when I learn electronics and related skills it’s helpful to have an in person teacher who can show me and explain thoroughly rather than re reading instructions. In the design center, I know that workers are available to help but I typically stick with what I know I have the knowledge to use like the sewing machine. I do have an interest in the other machines that make cool stuff like laser cutting to make jewelry but I feel that my inhibition is why I don’t really use the other machines. It seems like a lot of work to have the creativity to want it make something, to ask for help on how to use the machine to make it, and if it doesn’t turn out right then I’ll have to dedicate more time and practice to it. What I’m realizing is that I get frustrated if I’m not good at something immediately AND I’m shy and lazy. ","I wasn't expecting the zine material of learning electronics to be as basic as it was, yet creating a circuit also seemed quite daunting the first time I read through instructions. I like that the information was very straight-forward and clear/described in simple language. The images were also very helpful in breaking down the instructions both components were equally working together to explain the concepts rather than having one just as supplementary to another. But since the language and images used were quite straight-forward I feel that I understood well how to do it. Also because the zine pages are smaller and segmenting information so not too much information is on each page, it feels more palatable and less intimidating. There was nothing in particular that I disliked, but that I found myself having questions (like I was confused why the LED light was across the gap after I read that the current doesn't cross the gap, but this question might also just be irrelevant to the project and more so my own curiosity to know why/clarify my misunderstanding) that I couldn't find answers to.

It was very simple language to help people with little to no knowledge learn at an accessible level. Additionally, I enjoyed the illustrations, which are very helpful. They made me feel very capable of understanding and participating with arudino and electronics. I didn't love the way the last circuit was explained. There were a lot of wires and I couldn't figure out the reason for all of them.  I would love an explanation for each element. "

I perceive my lack of knowledge about/experience in computer/electronics-related topics as a barrier to my learning electronics. At the same time, however, I like experimenting with new things and find a lot of fulfillment in the problem-solving process. Thus, I feel that electronics might be something that I enjoy learning about, even with my lack of knowledge and experience. ","I liked having a physical booklet to flip through, because I was able to flip back and forth between pages. This helped me refer back to previous information and compare old information as I was presented with new information. I also liked that the zine was a mix of images and words (the images in particular were very helpful because I was not very familiar with electronics prior to this study). I thought the zine provided the necessary amount of information/detail without overwhelming me (and is therefore likely to be a welcoming resource to beginners). It provided additional information/resources (such as the QR codes) in a way that was accessible but not overwhelming/cluttered the zine itself."

I have learned how to use the cricut, the dye sublimation printer and the laser cutter using the zines in the design center and found them really helpful and easy to use. I also will usually ask for help from someone in the design center and learn that way as well. Usually literature is hard for me to learn from but since the zines have screenshots highlighting where certain selections are and also click-by-click instructions I've found I've been able to use them. Sometimes youtube videos are helpful. I've found learning electronic systems is like jumping in a pool and you just have to do it even though it doesn't come natrually to me",Compared to other zines I've read in the design center this one was a bit harder to follow. The diagrams were a little overwhelming to me and I feel like I could have learned better following along with a video of how to hook up all the connection points. I also think there are too many exclamation points in the literature.

I definitely learn better with visual aids and learning on my own, and the visual aids in the Zine were very clear and helpful in my learning. There were some things I didn't understand from the descriptions, especially because people were talking in the design center and that didn't help, but the visual aids helped to confirm my understanding and make the text more digestible. I think my learning could have been further advanced if the text part of the Zine was in bullet form and if the design center had been quiet (I get really distracted by auditory stimuli, so I was tempted to get my airpods out for noise canceling purposes)."

The use of analogy was helpful in understanding electricity and I felt like information was structured in the zine in a logical and buildable way. For bigger chunks of text, the use of bold typeface was helpful for guiding my reading. The zine was also very cute and encouraging!"

Also, specifically with electronics, there is a (at least perceived) greater safety concern; unlike other more easily learnable skills/crafts, I feel as though a youtube tutorial would not sufficiently teach me, and I am generally shy so I would not ask someone to teach me. 
Also the parts are small! I think.. I want to take apart a phone and look at all the electronic bits but I think there may be some social stigma stopping me from this. ","I liked how the zine broke it down into simple steps that I could understand individually. Once I understood the steps individually the instructions then built on one another and to became slightly more complicated. I liked the learning progression; it made me feel like I was actually learning! The arduino part was a bit confusing, though. I would have to spend more time rereading the zine and doing the activity itself to be able to understand it, I think. While I didn't fully understand the setup/where & why the wires were supposed to be connected to the arduino, I am definitely curious about it, and interesting in learning more! I want to come to the workshop. "

When it comes to electronics, I find that having a knowledgeable instructor that is able to work patiently with me (patience is key, I struggle with understanding electronics!) is essential to my experience. I think at a certain point I would gain enough confidence to experiment with/learn different electronics on my own, but don't feel I am quite there yet. I know the Design Center is staffed with people who could provide the assistance I am looking for, but I still feel intimidated going to learn without any prior knowledge or a specific project in mind. On the most basic level, the process of learning something new is time consuming and I find that learning electronics in particular is not something I prioritize because of this (in conjunction with intimidation).","I really enjoy the zine format! Each page gave me bite-size amounts of information that made it easy for me to understand both the information about electricity and follow the instructions clearly. The small amount of information on each page, which was all new to me, also made the subject feel less overwhelming to engage with. I definitely noticed that I had gut fear (?) reactions to certain terms that I associate with the world of electronics, but the thorough definitions and overall brevity of the lesson eased some of this instinctual anxiety. I could see myself using a zine like this to build up my experience/knowledge of electronics in the Design Center before attending a group event or pursuing my own project."
40,0,4,4,3,4,2,4,4,4,1,1,0,0,1,0,13,2,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,2,3,"I think one of the barriers that first come to mind is access. Growing up, I had limited access to the internet and technology so I remember that when I first learned how to use computers in high school that I always felt intimidated with just experimenting with different apps/softwares. Now, I am not as easily intimidated by technology/electronics, but since my major is not so tech heavy it can sometimes feel intimidating using tech/new tools/electronics, especially without any guidance. Exploring new technologies is also not something that is enforced/encouraged in a lot of my humanities courses which also adds to how I am able to access knowledge. If I'm not required/encouraged to use other mediums in class, then I won't really go out of my way to learn something, which I think is just a part of being a college student with a busy/hectic schedule. ","I really liked the format of the zine and how it was able to use analogies to make some terms easier to understand, for example the ""electricity is like water"" analogy. It provided really simple definitions for terms that I wasn't really familiar with before, making them easier to understand. I also really enjoyed the photos that were used to explain some of the concepts about the wiring, I'm a visual/kinetic learner so knowing what the equipment looks like makes it easier for me to know what it I'm doing. The sectioning of the zine was also really helpful because it let me know as the learner that we were moving on to the next step/learning something new next. I'd also like to note that I understood more the parts of the zine that had pictures versus the pages that just had words (that's just how I learn though and I truly do appreciate how picture heavy everything was)!

Aside from sewing machines, I have no experience with using the technologies accessible at the Design Center. My lack of familiarity with these technologies can be intimidating, despite the support that the Center provides people with learning how to use them. I also feel like I often don't have the time  to invest into learning how to use the electronics before executing my project idea. The learning curve requires time and energy, and the electronics are also only accessible at the Design Center. ","I didn't know that the Design Center had this type of electronic materials available so I did not know what to expect for the zine. I have some experience with circuits from taking Physics a few years ago but I had never been taught about current using the analogy of water which was something in the zine that I found really helpful. On that note, I like how the zine started off with the basics of what electricity is to make the subject more approachable. I also appreciated how much visual information the zine provided through pictures and diagrams because it made me feel more prepared for the possibility of making my own circuit and being able to identify the different parts. I think the zine could have been a little more detailed in explaining the different joystick controls and what they mean, because that was a part that was less clear to me."

I appreciated the simplicity of the page design which enabled me to focus on the content rather than be overwhelmed by a super filled page. I think the images add to the effectiveness of the zine because I can envision myself using them as a reference to pick out the tools. I think I would definetely be flipping through the Zine while completing the project using it as a step-by-step instruction guide.

The barriers I see are a lack of very basic knowledge (about the actual objects/nomenclature, about the science behind it) and maybe because of this, a lack of interest (I dont know why or how I could use it to be helpful to me). My grandfather did electronics and they were kind of the reason he was able to emigrate to the US--so honestly I also feel like if I did get into it I'd like have to be naturally really good or into it. 

In terms of the learning process, I think that I could really benefit from hands-on learning, which seems difficult to coordinate. I also dont know anyone who teaches electronics or, again, why I might study it. I also dont know where the materials would be sourced for a class or for practicing on my own. I also presume it is a little dangerous (soldering with lead, getting electrocuted?) It makes me feel pretty disconnected with the discipline, and a little scared because I know so little! ","I liked that the size of the  pages limited how much could be conveyed because I was pretty intimidated by the scope of it! I liked the abundance of visuals and that it really started from the ground up in terms of knowledge. I also like that it only really included relevant information. The zine felt clear and conversational, so it also made me feel like I could ask a person here (because I was like reading it in the voice of a design center helper??). I like that the resources for going deeper were at the end (not distracting/daunting during the simple project). I appreciated the electricity/water analogy as someone who has not taken college physics or has any real concrete idea of the concept. I also liked the circle motif within the zine that indicated a new section, and the headings that helped me when I looked back on something I didnt understand (particularly, the flow of electricity on the breadboard). 

Things I disliked: maybe near the end a like ""so what"" thing? Like where else breadboards are used, or what we could make with this same understanding? (I guess if i used this irl in the design center I'd already have that idea). I also wonder if someone could make something that kept the zine propped up/open to ease it being a reference when trying to make something. Or if there could be a series for like next steps!"

I think learning about electronics can be intimidating at times!,I liked how visual it was. I really appreciated the labeling of diagrams. I liked the step by step nature of the instruction to how to build a circuit. The only question I had about the circuit after it was created was the direction in which the current was flowing.

I also liked the clear labeling of the images with arrows and colors. I felt like I was able to stay engaged with the directions because of that.

I’m also a tad confused what “learning electronics means” as in software or new devices because I think that depends as well. For new kinds of electronic machines, you have to repeatedly try and use them to become comfortable and also you can only use them in one particular setting. Whereas, for software, if you can download it on your computer that makes it more accessible but oftentimes they costs money or storage which acts as another barrier. ","I appreciated the images attached to the zine as they were helpful and I could visually picture what the instructions were advertising. At the same time, it was difficult for me to follow along as I felt like reading information is one thing but absorbing it is more difficult especially when I was unable to follow along with an actual circuit. Had I been following along directly, I think I would have had a better understanding of the content in the zine. I liked the self-test aspect. I perhaps would have appreciated more pages like the Breadboard Anatomy page because I think it helped me better understand the various components of a circuit and understanding their function in a visual diagram was most useful to my learning.

","I liked that there were a lot of clear visuals to accompany the text. I also liked the step by step walkthrough of the material and that there was an opportunity to follow along through a hands on lesson while reading the zine, even if I didn't do it for the purposes of the study. All of the information in the zine came with explanations for why that information was important, which I also found helpful. I'm not sure that there was anything I particularly disliked about the format of the information. "

I think a lot of electronics have user-friendly interfaces, and so I am not intimidated to learn how to use them.","I am a visual learner, and so having the zine format with pictures, and short descriptions of everything was great! Additionally, I thought it could be helpful to include examples of projects at the end to give some inspiration to those reading and utilizing it. Having the pictures and descriptions was great because I was able to directly understand the different concepts and components. I also liked the QR codes at the end, and thought they would be beneficial for additional learning. It might be beneficial to talk more about the applications of Arduino boards--I know the material touched on the fact that some arduino boards are sewn into clothing, maybe elaborate further."

Rarely do I have to use new technologies for projects, so if I choose to do so it is on my own accord. As a result, I must carve out time from my personal schedule to learn and familiarize myself with these new technologies. This then becomes a luxury that I don’t always feel is important enough or necessary for me to pursue, when I could just do lower stakes projects in faster ways. This makes me feel like creativity/ experimentation itself is rendered a luxury in high pressure environments, e.g. university, where time is pretty much gold.","I appreciated the images, text color coding, and analogies used in the zine which made the information feel more accessible to those without lots of prior electronics knowledge. It was also nice to have two practice circuits that built on each other! The scattered exclamations and collective pronouns (""let's"", ""we"") were very encouraging too. Overall I felt comfortable with the material presented and more enthusiastic about creating electrical circuits that before having read the zine. If I could suggest anything, I think I would have been more engaged if it were handwritten/illustrated but thats probably a personal aesthetic preference over anything else. (have you seen the WBAR zine manual? Theres a clip about it somewhere in this short doc https://www.theblueandwhite.org/post/wuh-bar-wbar and its super cute--I was reminded of it while reading yours.)"

I have always wanted to learn it but don't know what learning electronics means to my life and how can I apply it. I would like to design toys with electronics but it is always just an idea that never get implemented. Besides, I only have basic coding skills and limited cs/engineering background and I thought it would be hard to advance.","I enjoyed reading up to the breadboard. I did not know it was so intuitive and easy to prototype a circuit. But the part after the introduction of Arduino is hard for me, I did not get it at all because I never worked with Arduino before. But it is good to know that TinkerCAD circuit is a good resource for learning this because I am familiar with TinkerCAD."
